                "description": "Pregnancy ultrasound scan called Nuchal Translucency (NT) scan is the most important part during the 11 to 13 weeks check up timeline. The nuchal translucency scan measures the thickness of this fluid to assess the risk of Down's syndrome. The scan looks at and measures the thickness of your baby's nuchal fold, a fold of skin on the back of your baby's neck. Increased thickness might indicate a chromosomal abnormality, but it doesn't tell you that your baby has, or doesn't have an abnormality. The results will tell you if your baby is at high risk or low risk of chromosomal abnormality in comparison to the general population. The main purpose of the NT scan is to check chromosomal abnormalities like Down's syndrome."
