During this scan, the size of the baby is understood by measuring the circumference of baby's head (HC) and baby's tummy (AC), the length of baby's thigh bone (FL) and depth of the amniotic fluid around the baby. If the measurements are well within normal limits, your baby is likely to be doing just fine. In case, if your baby is either larger or small than expected, you will be advised to have a second scan two weeks later.
