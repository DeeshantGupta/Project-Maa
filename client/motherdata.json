A feeling of pressure in your tummy or even mild cramping without bleeding is very common, especially in first pregnancies, and is usually a sign that everything is going right, not that something's wrong. What you're feeling may be the sensation of embryo implantation, increased blood flow, the thickening of the uterine lining or even the growth of your uterus (and it could just be gas pains). Ask your doctor at your next visit if you're concerned, but it probably just means you're super tuned in to all the changes happening in your body."

Until they settle down in the second trimester, fight metal with acid: Sip lemonade and other citrus juices, suck on sour candy and (assuming your tummy can handle it) eat foods dipped or marinated in vinegar. Another thing to try? Brush your tongue every time you brush your teeth or gargle with a little salt water."

When you do go back to the salon, stick to highlights instead of root lightening or root-to-tip color changes (this way, the chemicals won't touch your scalp) and request a gentler coloring option, like an ammonia-free base. And be aware that hormonal changes can make your hair react differently, so you might not get exactly what you expect, even from your regular formula.

Enjoy teriyaki fish or chicken, miso soup, edamame and soba-noodle dishes from Japanese restaurants (as well as sushi featuring veggies or cooked fish).

So theoretically you could take one this early if you wanted to!

Drink water, diluted juice (white grape is easiest on the tummy), clear broth, weak decaffeinated tea or hot water with lemon, which can lessen gas. If you can't manage to sip, suck on Popsicles."

Here's the slightly confusing part: If you do give birth on that day, your baby will have clocked in only 38 weeks in utero, not 40. That's because the pregnancy countdown begins two weeks before your baby is even conceived — making you about four weeks pregnant before you see a positive pregnancy test. Regardless, you shouldn't plan your schedule around your estimated due date. After all, it is just an estimate. Most babies are born between 38 and 42 weeks, and babies of first-time moms are more likely to arrive on the later side. Only a handful of babies actually make their debuts right on schedule."

Welcome to the wacky world of food cravings and aversions. Hormones play a role here (as they do in most pregnancy symptoms) — especially in these early weeks when your body is getting used to the hormonal havoc. If you can’t beat ’em, join ’em — within reason. Indulge your chocolate cravings with a mini bar instead of a king-sized one and find healthy substitutes for the foods you can’t stand, like drinking a glass of V8 instead of eating a salads."

During the first trimester, a huge amount of energy goes into building a life-support system for your baby, especially the placenta, which can leave you feeling just a bit tired or full-on wiped out. Also to blame are the hormonal and emotional changes that are happening. The good news: By the end of your first trimester, your body will have completed the Herculean task of manufacturing the placenta, so you might feel a renewal of energy. In the meantime, listen to your body, which is telling you it’s burned out. Get plenty of rest and eat right — and often!"

To keep nausea under control, try eating a few crackers first thing in the morning. Whatever you do, don’t skip meals — even if the thought of eating makes you feel a little sick. Instead, be a grazer: Stick to foods that appeal to you, and try to follow a healthy diet."

Ginger can also be good for what ails you. Use it in cooking — like in ginger-carrot soup or ginger muffins — infuse your tea with it, nibble on some ginger biscuits, nosh on some crystallized ginger or suck on some ginger candy. And if your symptoms are particularly rough, ask your practitioner about taking a vitamin B6 supplement or switching your prenatal vitamin from one loaded with iron to one higher in B6."

Other workouts are fine, too, if they sit well with your stomach.

Or consider quinoa, a nutty grain that packs a super-punch of protein in a comforting package. If it's leafy greens that turn you a not-so-delicate shade of chartreuse, brighten up your diet with yellow vegetables (which are often easier to take), like carrots or yams.

Fish is one of the best sources of DHA (a healthy omega-3 fatty acid), so try to eat two to three servings of well-cooked shellfish, canned light tuna, salmon (wild-caught is best) or cod a week."

Substitute soy chips or baked chips for the greasy varieties. Or munch your way through some air-popped popcorn (tossed with some Parmesan for that salty kick you crave), rice cakes or pretzels. If your inner chocoholic is clamoring to come out, satisfy it with a cup of hot chocolate or a single-serving Fudgsicle instead of that king-sized Snickers bar. Screaming for ice cream?

As for acrylics, there's no proof that the chemicals are harmful to you or your fetus, but to be absolutely safe, you might want to forgo those tips until your baby arrives. Non-toxic and water-based ingredients in polish might also be a good idea, as is a well-ventilated salon (this is true whether you're pregnant or not). If your hormones didn't get the memo and you find that your nails have become weak or brittle, try a clear nail hardener and reapply often (plus make sure you're getting enough calcium)."

            "description":"Sure, you already got the news from your home pregnancy test — but it doesn't hurt to hear it confirmed by a doctor, which is one reason you're probably looking forward to your very first prenatal doctor's appointment. Expect this checkup to be exciting…and long. Ask your practitioner whether there are any COVID-19 rules you should know about and follow before coming in for your appointment. Once you arrive, you'll have a thorough physical, including a pelvic exam, Pap smear and initial blood tests to determine your blood type, Rh factor, whether you're iron-deficient and whether your baby is at risk for chromosomal abnormalities. You'll also be tested for sexually transmitted infections, immunity to rubella (German measles) and ethnic-specific genetic diseases. And you'll need to pee into a cup so your urine can be tested for glucose, protein, red and white blood cells, and bacteria. Be prepared to answer lots of questions — health histories can take a while — but more importantly, bring a list of some of your own. Wondering whether you and Joe (aka your beloved extra-foamy mocha cappuccino) will have to part ways now that you're expecting? Why your chest suddenly resembles a map of an interstate highway? If having sex can hurt your baby? Don't just sit there — ask! Remember, no question is silly now. While you’re at it, talk to your doctor about whether you should get noninvasive prenatal testing (NIPT) — a screening for chromosomal abnormalities recommended for some at-risk moms that’s given as early as week 10 of pregnancy."

If pimples are the problem, wash your face two to three times a day with a thorough but gentle cleanser — harsh ones will only leave skin more open to irritation.

But try to resist your cravings if they're sending you to a bowl of sugar-frosted cereal or a bag of kettle-cooked potato chips. Eat Cheerios topped with fresh Fruit and a drizzle of honey, or dive into a bag of soy crisps, which are packed with protein. If your cravings are for something you shouldn't have now that you're expecting — like unpasteurized soft cheese or sashimi — sub something that comes as close as possible to the object of your affections, like pasteurized feta and teriyaki salmon. If you find yourself craving substances that aren't food, like clay, ashes or laundry starch, contact your practitioner.

Don’t worry, you’re not alone — this condition affects 50 to 75 percent of expectant mothers.

During the second and third trimesters, you may put on an average of about one pound each week until you reach month 8, or about 20 to 28 pounds. The weekly gains will vary, though they tend to average about a pound apiece. In month 9, your baby's weight gain will continue with gusto, while yours will likely only total about two to three pounds; you might even lose in the days before delivery."

Begin with 10 minutes of a gentle warm-up, followed by five minutes of moderate exercise and a five-minute cool-down. Then increase the moderate segment by five minutes every week until you hit the recommended 150 minutes of weekly exercise (which averages out to 30 minutes a day, five days a week)."

As challenged as your tender first trimester appetite is right now, it's still up to the challenge of meeting your nutritional needs (after all, your baby is just a little bigger than a pea, so those needs are pretty tiny). In the meantime, if big meals are a big turnoff, eat at least six smaller but nutrient-packed mini-meals and snacks throughout the day. Not only will the mini-meals be easier for your queasy stomach to, well, stomach, but keeping your tummy a little bit filled is the best way to keep it from emptying out. Right now, focus on foods you find less offensive — even if it's crackers, crackers and more crackers. Choose a healthy option whenever your tummy doesn't protest — like making those crackers whole grain — and serve them up with a slice of mild cheddar. And don't forget to tap into the soothing power of ginger."

If avoiding spicy and greasy foods isn’t helping, try taking antacids. They contain extra calcium, which you need during pregnancy anyway. Ask about genetic tests If you’re 35 or older or if you have a family history of genetic conditions, now’s the time to consider talking to your doctor about common genetic screenings, including NIPT (noninvasive prenatal testing), performed after 9 weeks, and CVS (chorionic villus sampling), performed between 10 and 13 weeks."

During the second and and third trimesters, sleeping on your side is ideal for you and your baby-to-be. This position allows for maximum blood flow and nutrients to the placenta, since it puts less pressure on a large vein called the vena cava, and enhances kidney function."

Going for the green can also help you go — and you don't have to rely only on vegetables: A kiwi, for example, packs a potent laxative effect. Aim for 25 to 35 grams of fiber each day, but try to ease into it if you don't eat a lot of fiber already. On the flip side, be sure to cut back on those classic cloggers: refined grains, like white bread, white rice and refined cereals and pasta."

So get creative: Thread a rubber band around your jeans button, through the buttonhole and back around the button again or buy a belly band, which can hide your unbuttoned pants and smooth out your silhouette. Or keep your skirt partially unzipped in the back and wear a blouse, sweater or jacket over it to hide the evidence. You'll get a couple more weeks of mileage out of your favorites that way. When you're ready to venture into the world of maternity fashion, be savvy about your wardrobe. Buy as you grow, look beyond the maternity department for cute stuff that fits and don't sacrifice your personal style!"

            "description":"Constipation — it's one pregnancy symptom that no one wants to talk about. Need some tips to get things moving? First, scrutinize your supplements. Ironically, many of the supplements that do a pregnant body good (prenatal vitamins, calcium and iron supplements) can also contribute to constipation. Talk to your practitioner about possible alternatives, such as a slow-release formula, an iron-free prenatal or a vitamin that contains a stool softener. You can also get things going more smoothly by fitting in some kind of exercise (a brisk walk, yoga) daily. And don't forget, when you gotta go — go. As soon as possible. Holding it in can weaken your bowel muscles, making it harder to push out the poop. And remember to stay away from medications, including herbal ones, until you've checked in with your practitioner."

There's a reason for all this activity, though: Your body is building fat and increasing blood flow to the area, which will help prime you for breastfeeding once baby is here. Until the pain subsides — usually in the second or third trimester — apply an ice pack wrapped in a towel to your breasts. Or, if you prefer heat, take a warm (not hot) shower."

The nuchal translucency scan measures the thickness of this fluid to assess the risk of Down's syndrome. The scan looks at and measures the thickness of your baby's nuchal fold, a fold of skin on the back of your baby's neck. Increased thickness might indicate a chromosomal abnormality, but it doesn't tell you that your baby has, or doesn't have an abnormality. The results will tell you if your baby is at high risk or low risk of chromosomal abnormality in comparison to the general population. The main purpose of the NT scan is to check chromosomal abnormalities like Down's syndrome."

            "description":"Are your two favorite pastimes sitting and lying down? Pregnancy fatigue is normal. That's because you're running a baby-making factory that's in business 24/7, causing your pregnant body to work harder at rest than your non-pregnant body did on the run. And for the next few weeks, a baby's not the only thing in production — so is the placenta, the magnificently complex mission control that will serve as your baby's life support system until delivery. The result? You feel tired and overworked, even when you’re not doing a darn thing. Your energy should return once the placenta's up and running and your system adjusts as best as it can to the hormonal changes of pregnancy — probably early in the second trimester. In the meantime, keep your blood-sugar levels up with frequent snacks of complex carbs and protein, like cheese and crackers or nuts and dried Fruit. Or try a little exercise, which can actually give you an energy boost. Most of all — listen to your body. When it calls for a break, take one."

            "description":"If you haven't already, it's a fine time to get into the habit of eating breakfast and including two breakfast foods that are especially good for your pregnant body and baby-building: oatmeal and DHA-enriched eggs. Oats are full of fiber, B vitamins, iron and a host of other good-for-you-minerals. Fill your breakfast bowl with them, but don't stop there. Add oats — and all their nutritional superpowers — to pancakes and muffins (and cakes, cookies and even meatloaf). If you're eating eggs, that's great. The old egg is still a good egg, delivering a low-calorie, high-protein punch in a tasty little bundle. But you can boost the nutritional value by scrambling, frying or boiling ones enriched with DHA, a type of omega-3 fatty acid and \"good fat.\" It's a primary component of the brain and retina and is essential for brain development and eye formation in the fetus."

The scan looks at and measures the thickness of your baby's nuchal fold, a fold of skin on the back of your baby's neck. Increased thickness might indicate a chromosomal abnormality, but it doesn't tell you that your baby has, or doesn't have an abnormality. The results will tell you if your baby is at high risk or low risk of chromosomal abnormality in comparison to the general population. The main purpose of the NT scan is to check chromosomal abnormalities like Down's syndrome."

If your skin isn't too sensitive, you might want to try waxing and sugaring (ask your doctor if it's okay first), which is a long-term solution to unwanted hair. As for bleaches and hair removal creams and lotions, the jury is still out on whether they're safe to use during pregnancy, so consider shelving them until after you give birth."

The nuchal translucency scan measures the thickness of this fluid to assess the risk of Down's syndrome. The scan looks at and measures the thickness of your baby's nuchal fold, a fold of skin on the back of your baby's neck. Increased thickness might indicate a chromosomal abnormality, but it doesn't tell you that your baby has, or doesn't have an abnormality. The results will tell you if your baby is at high risk or low risk of chromosomal abnormality in comparison to the general population. The main purpose of the NT scan is to check chromosomal abnormalities like Down's syndrome."

Up your intake of this vital mineral by eating such iron-rich foods as beef, duck, soy products, spinach, dried Fruits and potatoes with the skins on.

What's more, many of the medications that relieve cold symptoms are off-limits during pregnancy. To feel better faster, be sure to drink up — warm beverages, like ginger tea and chicken broth, are particularly soothing, but water and cold juices will help you stay hydrated too. Gargling with salt water (¼ teaspoon of salt to 8 ounces of warm water) can help ease a sore throat, and eating a few teaspoons of honey may help get rid of a cough."

Guard against gastrointestinal discomfort by eating several small meals throughout the day — rather than three large ones — so as not to overload your digestive system."

There are as many of these myths around as there are people to repeat them (and try them out at family gatherings). And while they may be fun to talk about, they all have one thing in common: Whether they predict baby is a boy or a girl, they have a 50-50 chance of being correct. If you'd like better odds than that — the kind you can base your nursery paint colors on — ask your practitioner about your options for finding out baby's sex."

To monitor baby’s growth and position, your OB/GYN or midwife will likely start to measure the distance between the top of your pubic bone and the top of your uterus. Called the fundal height, this measurement is used as a reflection of how big your baby is."

Well, your baby doesn't mind if you opt out of the oatmeal and go for a toasted cheese sandwich instead — or even a slice of cold meatloaf from last night's dinner. If you forgo the morning meal because you’re not a morning person, you might want to try setting your alarm for 15 minutes earlier, so you'll have a chance to wake up and grab some granola and yogurt — even if you have to eat your breakfast on the run. If you're always in a rush, try to prepare something the night before, like a breakfast burrito that's ready to roll after a quick stop in the microwave or a bag of dry cereal and trail mix washed down with calcium-fortified juice. Or whip up a quick breakfast smoothie — put all the ingredients in the blender jar, stick it in the fridge then give it a whirl in the a.m."

Amniocentesis — also called \"amnio\" — is a procedure that extracts this fluid to detect conditions such as Down syndrome, Tay-Sachs, sickle cell anemia and more. If you or your baby's other biological parent has a history of genetic conditions, or if other screenings have detected an abnormality, you may want to ask whether you should have an amnio done."

Card-carrying baby-builders like you, though, get the pleasure of replacing those calories with some healthy pregnancy snacks. So 30 minutes before you exercise, hit the fridge for a light snack and a drink. Follow up your workout with an encore snack. Bananas and orange juice are great options because they contain plenty of potassium, an essential nutrient that's lost when you perspire, plus they supply quick energy. Add a little protein for staying power like a hard-boiled egg or a cheese stick."

If you're considered high-risk for preeclampsia, ask your practitioner about low-dose or baby aspirin. Taking baby aspirin (usually two a day, but check with your doctor) after the first trimester can reduce preeclampsia by 24 percent, according to some studies."
