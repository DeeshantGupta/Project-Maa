A feeling of pressure in your tummy or even mild cramping without bleeding is very common, especially in first pregnancies, and is usually a sign that everything is going right, not that something's wrong. What you're feeling may be the sensation of embryo implantation, increased blood flow, the thickening of the uterine lining or even the growth of your uterus (and it could just be gas pains). Ask your doctor at your next visit if you're concerned, but it probably just means you're super tuned in to all the changes happening in your body."

Until they settle down in the second trimester, fight metal with acid: Sip lemonade and other citrus juices, suck on sour candy and (assuming your tummy can handle it) eat foods dipped or marinated in vinegar. Another thing to try? Brush your tongue every time you brush your teeth or gargle with a little salt water."

When you do go back to the salon, stick to highlights instead of root lightening or root-to-tip color changes (this way, the chemicals won't touch your scalp) and request a gentler coloring option, like an ammonia-free base. And be aware that hormonal changes can make your hair react differently, so you might not get exactly what you expect, even from your regular formula. Before you do your whole head, see about trying a test strand to be sure."

Other good choices: pasta and pizza with fresh tomato sauce, pregnancy-safe seafood or cheese. Enjoy teriyaki fish or chicken, miso soup, edamame and soba-noodle dishes from Japanese restaurants (as well as sushi featuring veggies or cooked fish).

These days, you can find out you're expecting much earlier, faster and with better accuracy than ever before (though accuracy will, of course, get better the closer you are to that missed period). So theoretically you could take one this early if you wanted to! Still, it can take a week or more after you miss your period before you produce enough of the pregnancy hormone human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) to be detected on a test. If you're late and negative, retest in a few days."

Drink water, diluted juice (white grape is easiest on the tummy), clear broth, weak decaffeinated tea or hot water with lemon, which can lessen gas. If you can't manage to sip, suck on Popsicles."

Doing the math is actually a lot easier than you think — even if you slept through high school algebra. Your estimated due date is 40 weeks from the first day of your last period. Here's the slightly confusing part: If you do give birth on that day, your baby will have clocked in only 38 weeks in utero, not 40. That's because the pregnancy countdown begins two weeks before your baby is even conceived — making you about four weeks pregnant before you see a positive pregnancy test. Regardless, you shouldn't plan your schedule around your estimated due date. After all, it is just an estimate. Most babies are born between 38 and 42 weeks, and babies of first-time moms are more likely to arrive on the later side. Only a handful of babies actually make their debuts right on schedule."

Welcome to the wacky world of food cravings and aversions. Hormones play a role here (as they do in most pregnancy symptoms) — especially in these early weeks when your body is getting used to the hormonal havoc. If you can’t beat ’em, join ’em — within reason. Indulge your chocolate cravings with a mini bar instead of a king-sized one and find healthy substitutes for the foods you can’t stand, like drinking a glass of V8 instead of eating a salads."

During the first trimester, a huge amount of energy goes into building a life-support system for your baby, especially the placenta, which can leave you feeling just a bit tired or full-on wiped out. Also to blame are the hormonal and emotional changes that are happening. The good news: By the end of your first trimester, your body will have completed the Herculean task of manufacturing the placenta, so you might feel a renewal of energy. In the meantime, listen to your body, which is telling you it’s burned out. Get plenty of rest and eat right — and often!"

To keep nausea under control, try eating a few crackers first thing in the morning. Whatever you do, don’t skip meals — even if the thought of eating makes you feel a little sick. Instead, be a grazer: Stick to foods that appeal to you, and try to follow a healthy diet."

Ginger can also be good for what ails you. Use it in cooking — like in ginger-carrot soup or ginger muffins — infuse your tea with it, nibble on some ginger biscuits, nosh on some crystallized ginger or suck on some ginger candy. And if your symptoms are particularly rough, ask your practitioner about taking a vitamin B6 supplement or switching your prenatal vitamin from one loaded with iron to one higher in B6."

Other workouts are fine, too, if they sit well with your stomach.

Or consider quinoa, a nutty grain that packs a super-punch of protein in a comforting package. If it's leafy greens that turn you a not-so-delicate shade of chartreuse, brighten up your diet with yellow vegetables (which are often easier to take), like carrots or yams.

Substitute soy chips or baked chips for the greasy varieties. Or munch your way through some air-popped popcorn (tossed with some Parmesan for that salty kick you crave), rice cakes or pretzels. If your inner chocoholic is clamoring to come out, satisfy it with a cup of hot chocolate or a single-serving Fudgsicle instead of that king-sized Snickers bar. Screaming for ice cream?

As for acrylics, there's no proof that the chemicals are harmful to you or your fetus, but to be absolutely safe, you might want to forgo those tips until your baby arrives. Non-toxic and water-based ingredients in polish might also be a good idea, as is a well-ventilated salon (this is true whether you're pregnant or not). If your hormones didn't get the memo and you find that your nails have become weak or brittle, try a clear nail hardener and reapply often (plus make sure you're getting enough calcium)."

Expect this checkup to be exciting…and long. Ask your practitioner whether there are any COVID-19 rules you should know about and follow before coming in for your appointment. Once you arrive, you'll have a thorough physical, including a pelvic exam, Pap smear and initial blood tests to determine your blood type, Rh factor, whether you're iron-deficient and whether your baby is at risk for chromosomal abnormalities. You'll also be tested for sexually transmitted infections, immunity to rubella (German measles) and ethnic-specific genetic diseases. And you'll need to pee into a cup so your urine can be tested for glucose, protein, red and white blood cells, and bacteria. Be prepared to answer lots of questions — health histories can take a while — but more importantly, bring a list of some of your own. Wondering whether you and Joe (aka your beloved extra-foamy mocha cappuccino) will have to part ways now that you're expecting? Why your chest suddenly resembles a map of an interstate highway? If having sex can hurt your baby? Don't just sit there — ask! Remember, no question is silly now. While you’re at it, talk to your doctor about whether you should get noninvasive prenatal testing (NIPT) — a screening for chromosomal abnormalities recommended for some at-risk moms that’s given as early as week 10 of pregnancy."

If pimples are the problem, wash your face two to three times a day with a thorough but gentle cleanser — harsh ones will only leave skin more open to irritation.

But try to resist your cravings if they're sending you to a bowl of sugar-frosted cereal or a bag of kettle-cooked potato chips. Eat Cheerios topped with fresh fruit and a drizzle of honey, or dive into a bag of soy crisps, which are packed with protein. If your cravings are for something you shouldn't have now that you're expecting — like unpasteurized soft cheese or sashimi — sub something that comes as close as possible to the object of your affections, like pasteurized feta and teriyaki salmon. If you find yourself craving substances that aren't food, like clay, ashes or laundry starch, contact your practitioner.

Don’t worry, you’re not alone — this condition affects 50 to 75 percent of expectant mothers.

During the second and third trimesters, you may put on an average of about one pound each week until you reach month 8, or about 20 to 28 pounds. The weekly gains will vary, though they tend to average about a pound apiece. In month 9, your baby's weight gain will continue with gusto, while yours will likely only total about two to three pounds; you might even lose in the days before delivery."

Begin with 10 minutes of a gentle warm-up, followed by five minutes of moderate exercise and a five-minute cool-down. Then increase the moderate segment by five minutes every week until you hit the recommended 150 minutes of weekly exercise (which averages out to 30 minutes a day, five days a week)."

As challenged as your tender first trimester appetite is right now, it's still up to the challenge of meeting your nutritional needs (after all, your baby is just a little bigger than a pea, so those needs are pretty tiny). In the meantime, if big meals are a big turnoff, eat at least six smaller but nutrient-packed mini-meals and snacks throughout the day. Not only will the mini-meals be easier for your queasy stomach to, well, stomach, but keeping your tummy a little bit filled is the best way to keep it from emptying out. Right now, focus on foods you find less offensive — even if it's crackers, crackers and more crackers. Choose a healthy option whenever your tummy doesn't protest — like making those crackers whole grain — and serve them up with a slice of mild cheddar. And don't forget to tap into the soothing power of ginger."

            "description":"Are you feeling the burn — heartburn, that is? For many, heartburn is among the earliest symptoms of pregnancy, beginning around the second month. If avoiding spicy and greasy foods isn’t helping, try taking antacids. They contain extra calcium, which you need during pregnancy anyway. Ask about genetic tests If you’re 35 or older or if you have a family history of genetic conditions, now’s the time to consider talking to your doctor about common genetic screenings, including NIPT (noninvasive prenatal testing), performed after 9 weeks, and CVS (chorionic villus sampling), performed between 10 and 13 weeks."

During the second and and third trimesters, sleeping on your side is ideal for you and your baby-to-be. This position allows for maximum blood flow and nutrients to the placenta, since it puts less pressure on a large vein called the vena cava, and enhances kidney function."

Going for the green can also help you go — and you don't have to rely only on vegetables: A kiwi, for example, packs a potent laxative effect. Aim for 25 to 35 grams of fiber each day, but try to ease into it if you don't eat a lot of fiber already. On the flip side, be sure to cut back on those classic cloggers: refined grains, like white bread, white rice and refined cereals and pasta."

            "description":"Sooner or later, every pregnant woman enters that period of fashion limbo. Right now, you're too big for your jeans but too small for maternity wear. So get creative: Thread a rubber band around your jeans button, through the buttonhole and back around the button again or buy a belly band, which can hide your unbuttoned pants and smooth out your silhouette. Or keep your skirt partially unzipped in the back and wear a blouse, sweater or jacket over it to hide the evidence. You'll get a couple more weeks of mileage out of your favorites that way. When you're ready to venture into the world of maternity fashion, be savvy about your wardrobe. Buy as you grow, look beyond the maternity department for cute stuff that fits and don't sacrifice your personal style!"

            "description":"Constipation — it's one pregnancy symptom that no one wants to talk about. Need some tips to get things moving? First, scrutinize your supplements. Ironically, many of the supplements that do a pregnant body good (prenatal vitamins, calcium and iron supplements) can also contribute to constipation. Talk to your practitioner about possible alternatives, such as a slow-release formula, an iron-free prenatal or a vitamin that contains a stool softener. You can also get things going more smoothly by fitting in some kind of exercise (a brisk walk, yoga) daily. And don't forget, when you gotta go — go. As soon as possible. Holding it in can weaken your bowel muscles, making it harder to push out the poop. And remember to stay away from medications, including herbal ones, until you've checked in with your practitioner."

There's a reason for all this activity, though: Your body is building fat and increasing blood flow to the area, which will help prime you for breastfeeding once baby is here. Until the pain subsides — usually in the second or third trimester — apply an ice pack wrapped in a towel to your breasts. Or, if you prefer heat, take a warm (not hot) shower."

If the measurements are well within normal limits, your baby is likely to be doing just fine. In case, if your baby is either larger or small than expected, you will be advised to have a second scan two weeks later. These serial scans help to accurately track the baby's growth and take appropriate actions if required."

The breech position means that your baby is in a bottom-down and head up position inside your womb. Throughout your pregnancy, your baby will be moving around in your womb. But around eight months of pregnancy, the baby will settle in one position. The head down position is the good and normal position of the baby and observed in about 96% of the babies. But few babies will settle into bottom-first or a breech position.In case if your baby is in the breech position or there are any other conditions which demand caesarean section (LSCS). In such conditions your caesarean section will be planned during this week."

During a nonstress test, the baby's heart rate is monitored to see how it responds to the baby's movements. The term \"non stress\" refers to the fact that nothing is done to place stress on the baby during the test.Typically, a nonstress test is recommended when it's believed that the baby is at an increased risk of death. A nonstress test may be done after 26 to 28 weeks of pregnancy. Certain nonstress test results might indicate that you and your baby need further monitoring, testing or special care.A nonstress test is a noninvasive test that doesn't pose any physical risks to you or your baby"
